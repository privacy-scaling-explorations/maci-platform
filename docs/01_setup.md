# Setup

Follow these instructions to deploy your own instance of MACI-RPGF.

## 1. Fork Repo

[Fork MACI-RPGF](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci-rpgf/tree/main)

1. Click to view the `.env.example` file in your newly created repo
2. Copy its contents and paste into a text editor

## 2. Configuration

The `.env.example` file contains instructions for most of these steps.

At the very minimum you need to configure a postgres database, nextauth, admin address, and the EAS Schema under App Configuration.

#### Database

https://vercel.com/dashboard/stores?type=postgres

1. Press Create Database button
2. Select Postgres, press continue, and give it a name and region
3. Press `.env.local` tab, Copy Snippet and paste into text editor

    <img width="45%" src="./images/create_postgres.png" />
    <img width="45%" src="./images/create_postgres_details.png" />
</div>

#### Auth

1. Generate a secret (`openssl rand -base64 32`)
2. Configure `NEXTAUTH_URL` (this should only be necessary on localhost or for production domains)

#### Network

The default configuration is Optimism.

You can find supported networks on the EAS documentation website: https://docs.attest.sh/docs/quick--start/contracts

#### App

Configure how many votes each voter receives and how many votes each project can receive.
You can also find configurations for when voting starts and ends as well as the registration and review period.

Here, you can also configure who your admins are. These are the users who will approve applications and voters.

To create your own round you need to do a few things:

- Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESSES` with a comma-separated list of wallet addresses that approve the applications and voters (badgeholders)
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROUND_ID` to a unique identifier that will group the applications and lists you want to list
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MACI_START_BLOCK` - block where your maci contract is deployed (optional)
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TALLY_URL` - your endpoint for vote results, where you host `tally-{pollId}.json` files.

#### EAS

If you are running on a different network than Optimism you need to update the contract addresses for EAS. These addresses are used whenever an attestation is created.

You can also configure your own schemas here if you wish to, or deploy the EAS contracts to a network that doesn't have them.

## 3. Download .zkey files

Note the locations of the .zkey files as the CLI requires them as command-line flags. Download ceremony artifacts:

```bash
pnpm download:ceremony-zkeys
```

## 4. Deploy Frontend

https://vercel.com/new

1. Import the repo you created/forked
2. Open the Environment Variables panel
3. Select the first field and paste your variables from your text editor
4. Deploy!

</div>

## Additional configuration

### Configure theme and metadata

Edit `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/config.ts`

_You can edit files directly in GitHub by navigating to a file and clicking the Pen icon to the right._

### Creating EAS Schemas and Attestations

You can create your own schemas by running this script.

```sh
WALLET_PRIVATEKEY="0x..." npm run eas:registerSchemas
```
