### Technical details

- **EAS** - Projects, profiles, etc are all stored on-chain in Ethereum Attestation Service
- **Batched requests with tRPC** - Multiple requests are batched into one (for example when the frontend requests the metadata for 24 projects they are batched into 1 request)
- **Server-side caching of requests to EAS and IPFS** - Immediately returns the data without calling EAS and locally serving ipfs cids.
- **MACI** - Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI) is an open-source public good that serves as infrastructure for private on-chain voting, handles the rounds and private voting of the badgeholders.
